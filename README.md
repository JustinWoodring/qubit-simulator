## Why qubit-simulator
I built qubit-simulator to help students, hobbyists and fellow academics become
more familiar with the 3d spatial representations of various well-defined gate
transforms on a qubit. If you love this tool, please share it, give it a star,
or consider sponsoring me!

## What is qubit-simulator
An interactive 3D bloch sphere visualization of a qubit with animations to show 
gate transforms and their respective effects on probability.

## What gates have you implemented?
- Hadamard Gate
- Pauli X Gate
- Pauli Y Gate
- Pauli Z Gate
- S (Phase) Gate
- T Gate

## Where can I try it out?
